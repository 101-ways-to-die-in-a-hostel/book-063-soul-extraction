The hostel was built when tourism arrived, providing a steady supply.

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
The ceremony temple - a walled compound within the hostel grounds. Traditional split gate (candi bentar), central pavilion with thatched roof, surrounded by shrines.

- Afternoon: Birdsong, water features, soft gongs from yoga classes

- Unique sounds: The hostel plays "healing frequency" music constantly; the temple has an acoustic quality that makes whispers carry

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Wayan (common Balinese name meaning first-born)
**Description:** 25, beautiful, serene smile that doesn't reach her eyes, trained to identify the most "open" guests
**Role in death:** Active participant - she identifies targets, builds trust, encourages ceremony participation

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Ketut | Maintains the "empty" bodies, speaks to them as if they're still people |
| Security | Made (male) | Ensures ceremony isn't interrupted, handles bodies |
| Bar/Kitchen | Komang | Prepares the "cleansing" herbs that open guests psychically |
| Shaman/Manager | Made Surya | Family patriarch, performs extractions, genuinely believes he's serving balance |

### Staff Knowledge
All staff are family members who know exactly what happens. They don't see themselves as evil - they're protecting their community by redirecting Rangda's hunger toward outsiders. The "empty" bodies are treated with a kind of respect, kept comfortable until disposal.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Peaceful, healing, Instagram-perfect. Guests do yoga, drink smoothies, share transformation stories. Everything feels designed to be photographed.

### Night Vibe
Quieter but still serene. Ceremony preparations happen discreetly. The temple is off-limits until the "right moment." Some guests report strange dreams.

### Guest Demographics
Wellness influencers, yoga teachers, burnout refugees, spiritual seekers aged 25-45, predominantly Western, predominantly female

### Reputation
"Life-changing experience." Reviews rave about the ceremonies, the staff, the transformation they felt. A few one-star reviews mention "something feeling off" but they're buried. Alumni return to do the ceremony again (not realizing they're watching fresh extractions, protected by having already been marked as "processed").

## Practical Details

### Getting There

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Ubud's wellness tourism industry is massive and real
- Balinese Hinduism does include trance practices and spirit communication
- Balian (traditional healers) are genuine community figures
- The exploitation of spiritual seekers by fake or corrupt practitioners is documented

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Balinese culture and religion should be portrayed with respect
- The antagonists are corrupted individuals, not representative of Balinese spirituality
- The critique is of Western spiritual consumerism, not Eastern traditions
- Real Balinese practices are protective and community-oriented
